### Claude Haiku 4.5

As an 18-year-old Computer Science major, I find myself at an interesting crossroads where traditional computational thinking collides with the humanistic inquiry of digital humanities. When I reflect on my digital literacy, I realize it extends far beyond syntax and algorithms—it encompasses the ability to navigate, create, and critically evaluate information across multiple platforms and disciplines.

My daily academic life involves a diverse toolkit of digital platforms that I've come to rely on without always pausing to consider their implications. For content creation, I use GitHub for version control and collaborative coding projects, Google Suite for documentation and shared assignments, and Discord for team communication across group projects. On social platforms, I navigate Instagram and TikTok more passively, but I'm increasingly aware of how these platforms shape algorithmic narratives and information dissemination. For research and data management, I've begun working with tools like Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis, Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation, and increasingly, platforms like Kaggle for accessing and exploring datasets. I also use Zotero for organizing research materials—a skill I wish I had adopted earlier. These tools have become extensions of my academic identity, though I'm only now beginning to understand how they mediate my learning and research processes.

What strikes me most about this course is how it has made visible the often-invisible labor of digital work. When I sit in this classroom alongside Film and New Media majors, Environmental Studies researchers, and Literature students, I see that digital literacy isn't uniform—we each bring different perspectives and skill sets to data and meaning-making. A Film major might understand narrative structure in data visualization in ways I instinctively overlook. An Environmental Studies student might ask critical questions about data collection methods that I, trained in mathematical correctness, might take for granted. A Creative Writing major might reframe how we think about algorithms as producing narrative structures. This interdisciplinary perspective has fundamentally challenged my assumption that computational thinking is a neutral, objective process.

Digital humanities has opened new horizons for me by suggesting that computation is not separate from humanistic inquiry—it's an extension of it. Where I once saw data as purely mathematical objects to be processed, I'm beginning to see them as representations of human experiences, choices, and systems. The question "What story does this data tell?" is as important as "Can I accurately compute this?" This reframing has implications for how I approach problems. Whether I'm building software or analyzing datasets, I'm now asking whose voices are represented, what biases might be embedded in my choices, and what alternative interpretations exist.

Collaboration has been essential to developing a more sophisticated computational thinking. Working with peers from different majors has revealed blind spots in my reasoning. When my Interactive Media classmate asks how a dataset might be visualized differently, or when my Literature peer questions the assumptions built into a classification system, I'm forced to think beyond efficiency metrics toward deeper questions of representation and meaning. This kind of critical collaboration transforms computational thinking from a solitary, technical pursuit into a dialogical practice grounded in humanistic inquiry.

The intersection of digital humanities and AI feels particularly urgent to me right now. As I learn more about machine learning and neural networks, I'm simultaneously grappling with questions about training data, algorithmic bias, and the ethical dimensions of automated decision-making. Digital humanities gives me a language for asking these questions—it's not just "Does this algorithm work?" but "What are the consequences of this algorithm working, and who bears the costs and benefits?" Understanding datasets as cultural artifacts rather than neutral inputs has fundamentally changed how I approach AI development.

Reflecting critically on my current abilities, I recognize both strengths and limitations. I'm comfortable with technical tools and debugging, yet I'm still learning to think historically about technology and its social implications. I tend toward solutions-oriented thinking, but this course is teaching me the value of remaining in questions and uncertainties. I'm discovering that digital literacy requires not just technical skill but cultural fluency, ethical reasoning, and epistemological humility.

What I'm discovering in this course is that the division between "digital" and "traditional" humanities is increasingly artificial. Data is everywhere; interpretation is unavoidable. Going forward, I want to explore how design thinking might bridge my computational background with humanistic inquiry. I'm curious about the ethics of AI development, about how to build technology that reflects diverse values, and about whether computational methods might serve not just efficiency but justice. I want to think more carefully about the platforms I use, the data I generate, and the digital literacy I hope to model for others.

This reflection is not an endpoint but a beginning. Digital literacy, I'm learning, is not a static skill to master but an ongoing practice of navigation, critique, and imagination in an increasingly computational world.

### GPT-4.1

As an 18-year-old Computer Science major, my journey with digital literacy is both a personal and academic adventure. Growing up in a world saturated with technology, I’ve always felt comfortable online, but university has challenged me to think more deeply about what it means to be truly digitally literate. It’s not just about knowing how to use the latest apps or write code—it’s about understanding, creating, collaborating, and questioning in a digital landscape that is constantly evolving.

#### Content Creation and Daily Strategies

In my daily life, content creation is second nature. I use Google Docs and Slides for assignments and group projects, and I’m proficient with collaborative tools like GitHub for version control and project management. For coding, I rely on Visual Studio Code and Jupyter Notebooks, which allow me to experiment with code, document my process, and share results with classmates. I also use Canva and Figma for designing presentations or infographics, which helps me communicate complex ideas visually—an essential skill in both Computer Science and interdisciplinary work.

Social media is another arena where digital literacy plays a big role. I use platforms like Discord and Slack for academic and extracurricular communication, and I’m active on Instagram and X (formerly Twitter) for personal interests. I’m aware of the importance of digital footprints and privacy, so I regularly review my security settings and think critically about what I share. I also know how to spot misinformation and use fact-checking sites when something seems off—a skill that’s become increasingly important in today’s information-rich environment.

#### Research, Data Management, and Analysis

For research, I use Google Scholar and my university’s library databases to find credible sources. I organize references with Zotero, which streamlines the process of citing and managing research materials. When it comes to data, I use Excel and Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization. For larger projects, I’ve started exploring SQL databases and cloud storage solutions like Google Drive and OneDrive to keep my work organized and accessible from anywhere.

Kaggle has been a recent discovery—a platform where I can find datasets, participate in competitions, and learn from the code of others. It’s a great way to practice data analysis and machine learning in a real-world context. I’m also learning about data ethics, especially when handling sensitive information, and I try to follow best practices for anonymization and security.

#### Interdisciplinary Collaboration and New Horizons

One of the most eye-opening aspects of university has been working with students from other majors. In group projects, I’ve collaborated with peers from Interactive Media, Film and New Media, Environmental Studies, Engineering, and Literature. Each discipline brings a unique perspective: Interactive Media students are great at user experience design, Film majors understand storytelling and visual impact, Environmental Studies students are passionate about data’s real-world implications, and Literature majors excel at critical analysis and narrative.

These collaborations have taught me that digital literacy isn’t just about technical skills. It’s about being able to communicate across disciplines, adapt to new tools, and appreciate different ways of thinking. For example, when working on a data visualization project, I learned from a Film major how to use color and pacing to tell a compelling story, while an Environmental Studies student helped us consider the ethical implications of how we presented our data.

#### Digital Humanities and Computational Thinking

Before this course, I thought of Computer Science as mostly technical—algorithms, data structures, and code. Digital humanities has shown me that computation can be a lens for exploring culture, history, and society. I’m fascinated by projects that use text analysis to study literature or map historical events using GIS tools. These approaches blend creativity with computation and open up new ways of understanding the world.

Collaboration in digital humanities has also helped me develop my computational thinking. I’m learning to break down complex problems, recognize patterns, and design solutions that are both efficient and meaningful. I’m also discovering the importance of asking critical questions: Who created this data? What biases might it contain? How can we use technology to amplify diverse voices rather than reinforce existing inequalities?

#### Critical Reflection and Future Directions

Reflecting on my current abilities, I feel confident in my technical skills but recognize there’s always more to learn. I want to become more fluent in data ethics, accessibility, and inclusive design. I’m curious about how AI and machine learning can be used responsibly, and I want to explore the intersection of technology and social good.

This course has inspired me to think beyond code and consider the broader impact of my work. I’m excited to learn more about digital storytelling, data journalism, and the ways technology can support creativity and critical inquiry. I hope to develop a mindset that balances technical expertise with empathy, curiosity, and a commitment to ethical practice.

In the future, I want to explore new programming languages, experiment with open-source projects, and collaborate with people from different backgrounds. I believe that digital literacy is a lifelong journey—one that requires adaptability, critical thinking, and a willingness to learn from others. As technology continues to evolve, so will my understanding of what it means to be digitally literate, both as a Computer Science student and as a global citizen.

### GPT-5 mini

I’m 18, studying Computer Science, and I’ve learned that digital literacy isn’t just technical fluency—it’s a hybrid of practical skills, ethical judgment, and collaborative curiosity. At the surface level, I can set up a Git repository, debug a web app, and run a Jupyter Notebook. Underneath that, I’m learning to ask why a dataset looks the way it does, who produced it, and how the tools I choose shape the stories I tell.

On a day-to-day level I use a mix of tools to create and manage work: `GitHub` for version control and code review, `Visual Studio Code` as my main editor, `Jupyter Notebooks` for exploratory data work, and `Google Drive`/`OneDrive` for sharing drafts and collaborating on documents. For rapid visual mockups I use `Figma` or `Canva`; for reference management I prefer `Zotero`. I frequently use Python with `Pandas`, `NumPy`, and `Matplotlib` for cleaning and visualizing data, and I’m starting to use `SQL` for structured queries. For datasets and inspiration, `Kaggle` and university library databases have been invaluable.

Some strategies I already use—useful for both daily life and academics—include:
- Versioning everything: commits, branches, and clear commit messages make collaboration and rollback simple.
- Reproducible workflows: I document steps in Notebooks and include environment specs (`requirements.txt`) so others can reproduce results.
- Metadata and organization: consistent folder structures and README files help teammates and future-me find things quickly.
- Regular backups and cloud sync: keeping work in the cloud plus local copies reduces loss risk.

These habits are practical but they also shape my critical approach. When preparing a dataset for analysis, I think about provenance (where did it come from?), structure (what fields exist?), and ethics (does it contain sensitive information?). For sensitive material I apply anonymization strategies and limit access—skills I’m still learning to do well.

Sitting in classes with students from Interactive Media, Film and New Media, Environmental Studies, and Literature has pushed me to expand what I count as useful skills. Film students teach me narrative pacing and visual composition—useful in dashboards and data stories. Environmental Studies students bring methods for field data collection and an attention to ecological context. Literature and Creative Writing peers teach rhetorical framing and the power of interpretation. When we collaborate, my coding skills combine with their domain insights: I build the tools, they give me the interpretive lens.

Digital humanities has broadened my sense of what computation can do. Instead of treating data as neutral inputs, I now treat them as artifacts—products of social processes, biases, and histories. Text analysis tools can reveal patterns in literature, network analysis can map relationships in archives, and GIS tools can uncover spatial narratives. These methods show how computation amplifies questions we might otherwise miss.

I’m also thinking a lot about AI and its implications. Learning about machine learning models is exciting but it’s also jarring to realize how much the model’s behavior depends on training data and labeling choices. Questions that used to feel theoretical—who is represented in this dataset?—are suddenly engineering decisions with moral consequences. I’m trying to pair technical competence with ethical frameworks: audit datasets, test models for disparate impacts, and document limitations.

Where I’m weakest now is the interpretive side: historical methods, archival labor, and deep domain knowledge. I’m comfortable writing code but less practiced at crafting persuasive humanities-style arguments or doing painstaking archival metadata work. I want to improve that by taking on interdisciplinary projects: building visualizations for literature classes, helping environmental researchers clean sensor data, and experimenting with text-mining on corpora.

In practical terms, future learning goals include:
- Deeper data management: learning about FAIR principles, data stewardship, and long-term preservation.
- Advanced analysis: mastering topic modeling, basic NLP workflows, and reproducible ML pipelines.
- Ethical practice: formal study of algorithmic fairness, privacy-by-design, and community-centered design.

Collaboration is central to how I’ll grow. Working with peers who have different expertise forces me to explain assumptions, accept critique, and adapt tools to new contexts. It also expands my sense of what counts as an interesting question: not just "Can I compute X?" but "Why compute X, and for whom?" That shift—toward questioning purpose as well as possibility—is the most important part of my developing digital literacy.

In the short term I’ll keep building reproducible notebooks, practicing clear documentation, and seeking interdisciplinary partners. In the long term I hope to combine rigorous computational skills with thoughtful, inclusive practices that use technology to surface new stories without erasing context. Being digitally literate means more than being able to build systems—it means being wise about when and how to use them.
